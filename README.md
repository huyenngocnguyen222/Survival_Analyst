Some models in Survival Analyst

Data: About Time (T_i) and Machine failure (C_i)

There are 3 models:
1. Kaplan - Meier: Base on real data, cannot relate to right-censoring
2. Weibull: For right-censored data, suitable for data that has only one phase of lifespan
3. Two-phase Weibull: Developed from Weibull to use for which data got 2 phases of lifespan, but in some cases, this model is not suitable (your dataset doesn't have elbow point).

These models are static models.
Enjoy!
